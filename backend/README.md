# Backend For Workout-App

In order to run the backend, define your port in an .env file
You will also have to create your own MongoDB Atlas Cluster to save data, which you can do on their website
Once that is done, you will have to get the connection string from the cluster, and add it to a .env file of your own.

## Running the Server

Run by `npm run dev` after changing directory to the backend folder in the terminal
TODO(shivpatel03) Make this compatible with Heroku Launcher instead of running the development version
